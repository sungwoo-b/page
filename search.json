    "text": "The surface of Antarctica is largely covered by sea ice, and its area changes over time. This project aims to explore how these changes are related to the movement patterns of penguins, one of the continent’s representative species, as seasonal variations in sea ice may impact their behavior and migration patterns.\n\nSea Ice Concentration Data\nSea Ice Concentration data is obtained from the NOAA Polar Watch ERDDAP Data Server and NetCDF format data was used in this project. This data includes time, coordinates, and Sea Ice Concentration data.\nData and its details can be accessed through the link below.\n\nhttps://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nsidcG02202v4shmday.html\n\n\n\nSouth Polar Projections\nThere are methods to represent the spherical Earth on a flat surface. Using the two projection methods below, the South Polar region of the data used here can be displayed on a flat map.\nI. Polar Stereographic Projection\nThe Polar Stereographic Projection is a projection method centered on the polar regions, and in this case, it is centered on the South Pole.\nDetails about the Polar Stereographic Projection can be found from the link below.\n\nhttps://nsidc.org/data/user-resources/help-center/guide-nsidcs-polar-stereographic-projection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue areas in the map above represent Sea Ice Concentration, the concentration levels can be referenced using the color bar.\nII. EPSG Code 3412\nAnother projection method is to use a location-specific EPSG code. The EPSG code for the South Pole is 3412, and the map below shows the projection using this code.\nOther EPSG Codes can be found from the link below.\n\nhttps://epsg.io/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelie Penguin Telemetry Data\nAdelie Penguin Telemetry Data was obtained from NOAA NCEI and can be accessed through the link below.\n\nhttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov/node/6696\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirdId\nSex\nAge\nBreed Stage\nDateGMT\nTimeGMT\nLatitude\nLongitude\nArgosQuality\n\n\n\n\n0\nADPE1\nfemale\nadult\nincubation\n28/10/1997\n7:54:00\n-62.171667\n-58.445000\n2\n\n\n1\nADPE1\nfemale\nadult\nincubation\n28/10/1997\n9:32:00\n-62.173333\n-58.463333\n2\n\n\n2\nADPE1\nfemale\nadult\nincubation\n28/10/1997\n18:15:00\n-62.158333\n-58.426667\n1\n\n\n3\nADPE1\nfemale\nadult\nincubation\n28/10/1997\n19:57:00\n-62.175000\n-58.441667\n2\n\n\n4\nADPE1\nfemale\nadult\nincubation\n28/10/1997\n21:37:00\n-62.171667\n-58.445000\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table above shows a sample of the Telemetry Data\nThe Distribution of Penguins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distributions are shown above to better understand the data, allowing for further analysis based on different categories.\n\n\nPenguin Locations on the Projected Map\nThe locations of penguins on Earth are shown as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Penguin Tracking Considering Various Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the daily movement paths of penguins by sex, illustrating the differences in movement patterns between sex groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the daily movement paths, including direction, filtered only to include data with Argos Quality of 3 and 2, which indicate data accuracy.\nNote:\n\nArgos Quality 3 - an error of less than 150 meters (with 4 or more messages)\nArgos Quality 2 - an error between 150 and 350 meters (with 4 or more messages)\n\n\n\nMonthly Tracking with Sea Ice Concentration\nBird ID ADPE24 (Female)\nThe individual with the most data is used as a representative example below, and its paths over time are shown with the corresponding sea ice concentration below. This can show the relationship between Sea Ice Concentration and penguin movement patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, ADPE24 has data from January to March 2003, and it traveled from the island towards areas with higher sea ice concentrations. The sea ice concentration varies by month, and it is clear that ADPE24 follows these changes. Although this is just one example, it suggests that there is a relationship between sea ice and penguin movement patterns."
