    "text": "In evaluating a pitcher’s performance, various metrics such as ERA, WHIP, FIP, and SIERA are commonly used. However, these metrics can introduce noise and become less reliable, especially when the sample size is small. This project aims to define a stabilized metric that offers a more consistent and reliable method of assessing a pitcher’s performance.\nStuff+ is a metric that focuses on evaluating each pitch by considering its physical characteristics such as pitch location, speed, spin rate, and more. Unlike other metrics, which provide an overall performance, Stuff+ offers insights into the effectiveness of each individual pitch. This metric was conceptualized by Max Bay and Eno Sarris, and many people have created and tested their own Stuff+ models.\nFor more details about Stuff+, refer to the link provided below.\n\nhttps://library.fangraphs.com/pitching/stuff-location-and-pitching-primer/\n\n\nData\nThe data used in this project is from Statcast, accessed via pybaseball, and includes every pitch from the 2023 MLB season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplayer_name\npitch_name\ndescription\nrelease_speed\nrelease_pos_x\nrelease_pos_z\np_throws\npfx_x\npfx_z\nplate_x\n...\naz\neffective_speed\nrelease_spin_rate\nrelease_extension\nrelease_pos_y\nspin_axis\ndelta_run_exp\npitch_name_label\ndescription_label\ncs\n\n\n\n\n2438\nRobertson, Nick\nChangeup\nhit_into_play\n89.0\n-2.8\n5.59\n1\n-1.53\n0.33\n0.33\n...\n-27.922064\n90.7\n1703\n7.4\n53.11\n250\n-0.233\n1\n8\n0\n\n\n2488\nRobertson, Nick\n4-Seam Fastball\nfoul\n96.9\n-2.4\n5.9\n1\n-0.76\n1.36\n0.09\n...\n-12.836434\n98.4\n2153\n7.4\n53.13\n211\n0.0\n0\n4\n0\n\n\n2581\nRobertson, Nick\nChangeup\nball\n90.0\n-2.93\n5.56\n1\n-1.65\n0.36\n-0.24\n...\n-26.599717\n91.5\n1698\n7.4\n53.14\n250\n0.041\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n2688\nRobertson, Nick\nSweeper\nball\n82.2\n-3.09\n5.55\n1\n1.43\n0.28\n0.81\n...\n-28.491928\n82.4\n2786\n6.9\n53.63\n58\n0.022\n8\n0\n0\n\n\n2793\nRobertson, Nick\nChangeup\nswinging_strike\n89.2\n-2.87\n5.58\n1\n-1.49\n0.31\n-0.78\n...\n-28.148796\n90.5\n1589\n7.2\n53.29\n257\n-0.061\n1\n10\n0\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 26 columns\n\n\n\nDetails about the variables can be found at the link below.\n\nhttps://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs\n\n\n\nDistributions of Pitch-Related Variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots above provide an overview of the data. It allows a better understanding of the data’s structure and distribution.\n\n\nMethod\nTo define Stuff+, the metrics, such as spin rate, horizontal and vertical break, and other pitch characteristics were considered as covariates and CS% (Called Strike Percentage), CSW% (Called Strike + Whiff Percentage), strikeout percentage (K%), and changes in run expectancy as the corresponding response indicators that represent the performance of the pitches. However, after evaluating the consistency of these metrics, Whiff% was chosen as the primary indicator.\nIn this project, Stuff+ was defined using the following formula.\n\\[\n\\text{Stuff+} = \\frac{\\text{Predicted Whiff\\%}}{\\text{mean League predicted Whiff\\%}} \\cdot 100\n\\]\nand Whiff% is computed as follows\n\\[\n\\text{Whiff\\%} = \\frac{\\text{Missed Swings (swinging strike, swinging strike blocked, missed bunt)}}{\\text{Total Swing Attempts}}\n\\]\nThis Predicted Whiff% is used to ensure stable outputs because it relies on probability. This approach is based on the methodologies referenced from A. Jon (2023), Cameron Grove (2021), and RG Pitching (2023).\nTo find the Predicted Whiff%, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest were considered. Although algorithms like XGBoost were more robust compared to Random Forest, Logistic Regression provided the most consistent and reliable results. Therefore, Logistic Regression was used to predict Whiff% in this project.\n\nCorrelation Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the correlation matrix, with the last row and column representing Whiff%.\n\n\nPitch Location vs CS% and Whiff%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots above show CS% (Called Strike Percentage) and Whiff% based on different pitch locations.\n\n\n\nStuff+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above displays the standardized Stuff+ for each pitch type. Each Stuff+ is centered around 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPitcher\nAbbott, Andrew\nCorbin, Patrick\nScherzer, Max\nDarvish, Yu\nSears, JP\n\n\n\n\n4-Seam Fastball\n106\n67\n107\n117\n109\n\n\nChangeup\n87\n128\n90\n&lt;NA&gt;\n80\n\n\nCurveball\n101\n&lt;NA&gt;\n108\n102\n119\n\n\nCutter\n&lt;NA&gt;\n&lt;NA&gt;\n117\n102\n&lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nKnuckle Curve\n&lt;NA&gt;\n&lt;NA&gt;\n&lt;NA&gt;\n90\n&lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nSinker\n114\n103\n&lt;NA&gt;\n101\n104\n\n\nSlider\n&lt;NA&gt;\n131\n116\n89\n84\n\n\nSplit-Finger\n&lt;NA&gt;\n&lt;NA&gt;\n&lt;NA&gt;\n95\n&lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nSweeper\n110\n&lt;NA&gt;\n&lt;NA&gt;\n85\n76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table above shows the Stuff+ for each pitch type by the selected pitchers.

It demonstrates how extracting features from handwritten digit images can lead to effective and accurate classification, by reducing the dimensionality and focusing on important features.\n\nMNIST Handwritten Digit Data\nThe data used in this project is the MNIST handwritten digit image dataset, which is widely used for image classification tasks.

This dataset contains a total of 70,000 images, with 60,000 images used for the training set and 10,000 images for the test set.\n\n\nRank-k Approximation using SVD\nIn this project, Rank-k Approximation via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used for classification method. This method extracts essential features and reduces dimensionality, improving efficiency. The SVD decomposition is as follows\n\\[\n\\text{Image Data} = U_k \\Sigma_k V_k^T\n\\]\nThis approach extracts essential information from the data, allowing each digit image to be represented in a reduced form. The focus is on the first k left singular vectors U, which capture the important features of the images. The k-th approximation is a linear combination of the vectors \\(u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_k\\), representing one element in their span.\n\\[\nA_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\alpha_i u_i\n\\]\nThe error between test images and the k-approximation is calculated using the Euclidean Norm, which measures the difference or distance between two data. The error is computed as\n\\[\n\\text{Error} = \\| \\text{Test Data Set} - \\text{k-Approximation} \\|_2\n\\]\nThe classification model predicts the digit by finding the smallest error, indicating the closest match between the test image and the k-approximation.\nThe goal is to find the optimal k that captures most of the data while keeping k as small as possible.\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot shows the classification rate for each value of k. For most cases, the classification rate is over 90% with k within 15, which demonstrates that dimension reduction was successful while capturing most of the data.\n\n\nConfusion Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n\n\n\n0\n969.0\n0.0\n2.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n6.0\n1.0\n2.0\n0.0\n\n\n1\n0.0\n1130.0\n3.0\n1.0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2\n17.0\n3.0\n962.0\n8.0\n4.0\n0.0\n2.0\n14.0\n22.0\n0.0\n\n\n3\n7.0\n1.0\n4.0\n941.0\n0.0\n23.0\n2.0\n8.0\n18.0\n6.0\n\n\n4\n1.0\n8.0\n1.0\n0.0\n957.0\n0.0\n4.0\n2.0\n2.0\n7.0\n\n\n5\n5.0\n2.0\n1.0\n18.0\n1.0\n837.0\n9.0\n1.0\n14.0\n4.0\n\n\n6\n9.0\n5.0\n0.0\n0.0\n3.0\n9.0\n930.0\n0.0\n2.0\n0.0\n\n\n7\n1.0\n15.0\n16.0\n1.0\n6.0\n0.0\n1.0\n956.0\n3.0\n29.0\n\n\n8\n7.0\n3.0\n6.0\n16.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n4.0\n911.0\n15.0\n\n\n9\n8.0\n8.0\n3.0\n6.0\n14.0\n6.0\n0.0\n12.0\n6.0\n946.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows the confusion matrix when k = 6, comparing the actual labels with the predicted labels.

    "text": "The surface of Antarctica is largely covered by sea ice, and its area changes over time. This project aims to explore how these changes are related to the movement patterns of penguins, one of the continent’s representative species, as seasonal variations in sea ice may impact their behavior and migration patterns.\n\nSea Ice Concentration Data\nSea Ice Concentration data was obtained from the NOAA Polar Watch ERDDAP Data Server and NetCDF format data was used in this project. This data includes time, coordinates, and Sea Ice Concentration data.\nData and its details can be accessed through the link below.\n\nhttps://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nsidcG02202v4shmday.html\n\n\nSouth Polar Projections\nThere are methods to represent the spherical Earth on a flat surface. Using the two projection methods below, the South Polar region of the data used here can be displayed on a flat map.\nI. Polar Stereographic Projection\nThe Polar Stereographic Projection is a projection method centered on the polar regions. In this case, it is centered on the South Pole.\nDetails about the Polar Stereographic Projection can be found from the link below.\n\nhttps://nsidc.org/data/user-resources/help-center/guide-nsidcs-polar-stereographic-projection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue areas in the map above represent Sea Ice Concentration, and the concentration levels can be referenced using the color bar.\nII. EPSG Code 3412\nAnother projection method is to use a location-specific EPSG code. The EPSG code for the South Pole is 3412, and the map below shows the projection using this code.\nOther EPSG Codes can be found from the link below.\n\nhttps://epsg.io/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelie Penguin Telemetry Data\nAdelie Penguin Telemetry Data was obtained from NOAA NCEI and can be accessed through the link below.\n\nhttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov/node/6696\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirdId\nSex\nAge\nBreed Stage\nDateGMT\nTimeGMT\nLatitude\nLongitude\nArgosQuality\n\n\n\n\n0\nADPE1\nfemale\nadult\nincubation\n28/10/1997\n7:54:00\n-62.171667\n-58.445000\n2\n\n\n1\nADPE1\nfemale\nadult\nincubation\n28/10/1997\n9:32:00\n-62.173333\n-58.463333\n2\n\n\n2\nADPE1\nfemale\nadult\nincubation\n28/10/1997\n18:15:00\n-62.158333\n-58.426667\n1\n\n\n3\nADPE1\nfemale\nadult\nincubation\n28/10/1997\n19:57:00\n-62.175000\n-58.441667\n2\n\n\n4\nADPE1\nfemale\nadult\nincubation\n28/10/1997\n21:37:00\n-62.171667\n-58.445000\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table above shows a sample of the Telemetry Data.\n\nThe Distribution of Penguins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distributions are shown above to better understand the data, allowing for further analysis based on different categories.\n\n\n\nPenguin Locations on the Projected Map\nThe locations of penguins on Earth are shown as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenguin Tracking Considering Various Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the daily movement paths of penguins by sex, illustrating the differences in movement patterns between sex groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the daily movement paths, including direction, filtered only to include data with Argos Quality of 3 and 2, which indicate data accuracy.\nNote:\n\nArgos Quality 3 - an error of less than 150 meters (with 4 or more messages)\nArgos Quality 2 - an error between 150 and 350 meters (with 4 or more messages)\n\n\n\n\nMonthly Tracking with Sea Ice Concentration\nBird ID ADPE24 (Female)\nThe individual with the most data is used as a representative example below, and its paths over time are shown with the corresponding sea ice concentration below. This can show the relationship between Sea Ice Concentration and penguin movement patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, ADPE24 has data from January to March 2003, and it traveled from the island towards areas with higher sea ice concentrations. The sea ice concentration varies by month, and it is clear that ADPE24 follows these changes. Although this is just one sample, it suggests that there is a relationship between sea ice and penguin movement patterns.\nModified: Oct 10, 2024."
